<p>@Required lib:
 - Boost
 - CMake</p>

<hr />

<p>The software is written in C++11 for the purpose of parameter learning 
in Sum-Product Networks. It supports batch learning, online learning as 
well as streaming learning. This software implements the following learning
algorithms for SPNs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Projected Gradient Descent.</li>
<li>Exponentiated Gradient Method.</li>
<li>Sequential Monomial Approximation (NIPS 2016).</li>
<li>Concave-Convex Procedure/Expectation Maximization (NIPS 2016).</li>
<li>Collapsed Variational Inference (ICML 2016).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Usage: </p>

<ol>
<li>batch_learning.cpp, online_learning.cpp and stream_learning.cpp should be the starting source files in order to understand the package.</li>
<li>All the code about network structures is implemented in SPNNode.[h|cpp] and SPNetwork.[h|cpp].</li>
<li>Learning algorithms under different learning scenarios, e.g., batch, online and streaming, are implemented separately in the corresponding *.cpp files.</li>
</ol>
